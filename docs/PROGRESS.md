# Progress

Where Slop Bucket stands, so a new session can pick up without the chat history. Update this file in each PR that moves the launch plan, changes what's next, or resolves an open issue.

**Last updated:** 2026-10-09 (after PR #17, the rename to Slop Bucket)

## Resuming in a new session

1. Read `CLAUDE.md`, then `docs/DESIGN.md` (source of truth), then this file.
2. For public-site work, also read `docs/UI-HANDOFF.md` (visual spec). Logos are in `docs/brand/logo-concepts/pail-pig-round-3/`.
3. Check `gh pr list` for open PRs, and the Status page at https://slopbucket.app/admin/status for what's running.

## Launch plan

| Step | Status |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Scaffold repo, D1 schema, CI | Done (#1) |
| 2. HN and lobste.rs adapters, classification | Done (#2, #3) |
| 3. GitHub adapter (Reddit dropped, Product Hunt waiting) | Done (#4) |
| 4. Admin review queue | Done (#5, #6) |
| 5. Admin status panel and settings | Done (#8, #10) |
| 6. 90-day backfill, review the queue | **Next**: re-classify for tags, then start the backfill |
| 7. Tune prompt, few-shot, categories, trending weights | Started early: classifier accuracy (#7), categories v3 (#11), tag vocabulary (#14) |
| 8. Lower the threshold, go public | Not started. Needs the public site (below) |

Built outside the plan's step list, all needed before launch: the daily trending job (#12), classify concurrency (#13), the admin Tools page with merge and split (#15, #16), and the rename to Slop Bucket (#17).

## Next steps, in order

1. **Re-classify for tags** (the owner, from the phone): Admin → Status → "Re-classify unreviewed posts…". The 433 posts queued before the tag vocabulary (#14) still carry tags from the migration, not from the new prompt. About $0.17 and 35 minutes.
2. **Start the 90-day backfill:** Status → Backfill, all sources, 90 days. That's about 28,000 posts and $11. The $2/day AI Gateway cap spreads it over about 5 days, and the In progress card shows progress.
3. **Review the queue** as it fills. Use Tools → Merge for duplicate tools. Mark good decisions as few-shot examples.
4. **Build while the backfill runs:**
   - **Queue page improvements** from `UI-HANDOFF.md` "Queue item": a "Resolves to" box (existing tool or New tool), tag chips with out-of-vocabulary tags struck through, and the model's reason as a plain quote. Agreed as the next build.
   - **The public site**, following the handoff's suggested build order: tokens, layout and category labels first, then the trending list, tool pages, search and filters. Merge redirects (301 from a merged tool's slug) are part of the tool page.
   - **Reports page** (admin); only matters once the public site is up.
5. **Step 7 tuning** against the backfilled data, then **step 8**: lower `review_threshold`, re-classify unreviewed posts so confident ones auto-publish, and go public.

## Open issues

- **Trending cron didn't run on Oct 9.** `source_runs` has only the manual trending run from Oct 8 20:49 UTC, and nothing from the 07:00 UTC cron on Oct 9, although the 06:00 fetch ran. Check tomorrow's 07:00 run on `sb-ingest`; if it's missing again, check the deployed cron triggers and the ingest logs.
- **Rename cleanup failed.** The `rename.yml` "cleanup" run on Oct 9 23:55 failed with R2 429 (rate limited) while deleting `radar-articles` objects. Re-run cleanup; already-deleted objects return 404, which the script ignores. Afterwards, delete `rename.yml` and `.github/scripts/copy-data.mjs`.
- **Unmerged commit:** `649a841` ("Attach slopbucket.app in the dashboard instead of wrangler routes") sits on `rename-slop-bucket` after #17 merged. Decide whether it's still wanted.
- **Re-classify operation never marked finished:** operation 1 has `finished_at` NULL, because finishing is written lazily when the Status page loads. It should close on the next Status view. If it doesn't, check `reclassifyProgress`.

## Production snapshot (2026-10-09)

- **Site:** https://slopbucket.app. Admin at `/admin`, behind Cloudflare Access.
- **Resources:** Workers `sb-ingest` and `sb-site`; D1 `sb`; R2 `sb-articles`; queues `sb-fetch` and `sb-classify`; AI Gateway `sb` (its $2/day cap counts GLM spend, confirmed in Analytics).
- **Crons (UTC):** 06:00 fetches all sources; 07:00 runs the trending job (engagement, GitHub stars, scores).
- **Migrations applied:** 0001–0010.
- **Data:** 511 queued posts, 2,421 dropped, 2 published, 1 rejected; 461 tools.
- **Classifier:** GLM 5.3 Flash (`@cf/zai-org/glm-5.3-flash`), reasoning `low`, two posts at a time (about 10–15 a minute). Eval: 82% precision, 94% recall on the 150 labeled posts. About $0.0004 a post.
- **Categories (v3):** agent, agent-addon, agent-tools, agent-security, review-testing, memory-context, ide, cli, mcp-dev, mcp-general, other. "other" fell from 51% to about 1.4% of the queue.
- **Tags:** four groups (Works with, Models, Platform, Interface) in the `tags` setting; the classifier may only use these.
- **Secrets:** `GH_API_TOKEN` is set on the ingest Worker (GraphQL star snapshots).

## Decisions worth remembering

- **Phone-only owner.** Every operation is an admin action or a `workflow_dispatch` workflow. Confirm before running anything that spends money or deletes data.
- **Classifier:** GLM 5.3 Flash replaced Llama 3.3 (39% → about 80% precision). Every MCP server is in scope (`mcp-dev` / `mcp-general`), but a product that merely offers MCP is judged by its main purpose.
- **Duplicate-URL reuse** needs the same classifier fingerprint (model, reasoning, prompt, categories, tags). Re-classify jobs are `force: true`.
- **Trending:** GitHub posts count as a source, but their stars aren't counted as upvotes; stars enter only as 7-day growth. Queued tools are scored too.
- **Tags:** Option C (four groups, Interface overlaps categories on purpose). Languages come from GitHub stats, not tags.
- **UI:** Tailwind v4, Heroicons, Tailwind Plus Elements only when JS is needed. No React. The admin ships no JavaScript.
- **Naming:** Slop Bucket at slopbucket.app, `sb-*` resources, `@slop-bucket/*` packages.

## Gotchas

- **D1 LIKE limit:** production rejects LIKE patterns over 50 bytes, while local SQLite and tests don't. Use `instr()` or `substr()`.
- **Local sqlite3 CLI:** needs `PRAGMA trusted_schema=1` to run migrations that touch `tools`, because of the FTS triggers.
- **Local `wrangler login` token** expires about hourly; run `npx wrangler whoami` first. Long local evals can fail midway with 401. It can't reach the AI Gateway config, Observability or Access APIs; use `wrangler tail` for logs.
- **Evals:** `pnpm --filter @slop-bucket/ingest eval:classifier -- --reasoning=low [--rpm=10] [--categories=…] [--tags=file.json]`. Model, categories and tags default to production's settings. Run-to-run noise is about ±3 points of precision. Use a lower `--rpm` while production is classifying, since they share the model's 20 requests/minute.
- **Shared working tree:** other sessions edit this repo too. Commit and push often, and `git add` only your own paths.
- **Copilot reviews** every PR. The owner wants its findings checked and fixed where they make sense before merging.
